 🕷️ Hello ZX-calculus world! - a graphical language for quantum circuits that traces back to Roger Penrose's tensor diagrams from the 1970s 🕸️

🤩 I was inspired by a talk from Bob Coecke last month at the Fields Institute, Toronto, who's doing amazing work bringing quantum computing education all the way down to kindergarten level. His vision of making quantum mechanics accessible through pictures and diagrams is especially compelling, given the reputation that category theory — which is integral to his approach — has for being abstract and impenetrable.

We have here a hands-on tutorial package exploring this graphical approach. It's satisfying how drawing quantum circuits as flexible "spider diagrams" instead of rigid gate sequences reveals optimizations that would be nearly impossible to spot otherwise.

The package includes:
• Interactive Jupyter notebook with visualizations
• Examples of T-count reduction for fault-tolerant quantum computing
• A demonstration of how quantum teleportation is topologically just a "bent wire" 🤯
• Theory overview

It's all built around PyZX. This categorical approach turns exponentially-hard problems into polynomial ones - just by changing how we draw things.
